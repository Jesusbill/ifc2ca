# ifc2ca
Files and scripts for the use of [`Code_Aster`](https://code-aster.org) in IFC-driven FEM analyses within the ifcOpenShell/BlenderBim Project

---

This project is now officially part of the [IfcOpenShell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell) project.

In [this folder](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.6.0/src/ifc2ca) you can find all the related scripts needed to perform a structural analysis workflow from a structural IFC file to Code_Aster.

A [dedicated repository](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/analysis-models) has been created within the IfcOpenShell Organization to host public analysis models. These models can also be used as a material for anyone interested in Code_Aster for structural engineering.
